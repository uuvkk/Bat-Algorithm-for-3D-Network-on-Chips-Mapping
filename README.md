# Bat-Algorithm-for-3D-Network-on-Chips-Mapping
This project is to solve what we call mapping problems for 3D Network-on-Chips (NoC), finished by me using C++ on Linux Platform, and it can also perfectly run on Mac OS (I am not sure whether it does on Windows). NoC is a novel architecture to design multi-processor chips, where the concept of network is introduced in System-on-Chips (SoC). Mapping is to distribute a task graph as an assignment of Intellectual Properties (IP) onto the topology structure of a NoC, trying to optimize one or more performance metrics of power consumption, execution time, delay and load balance. My target was to minimize the power cost, thus the mapping problem became a single-object optimization problem, which can be solved effectively by intelligence optimization algorithms, like genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm and particle swarm algorithm. I firstly used a novel meta-heuristic algorithm called Bat Algorithm (BA) proposed in 2012 to solve mapping problem.

What I did in this project were firstly building a 3D NoC platform, which we assume is a homogeneous chip, secondly making an approximate power model, also used as the fitness function in my iterations, and finally using BA to do the optimization iterations. In the code I uploaded, the graph I used was Video Object Plane Decoder (VOPD), as shown in the following Fig.
